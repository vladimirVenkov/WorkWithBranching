here is the first and until now main project (no branching yet)

https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Branching-Basic-Branching-and-Merging
after : $ git checkout -b FirstWorkingBranch 
we should be now creating and switching to this new branch (dunno what happens if other work on main is not resolved ?)
lets see if we are there ... here nvm :)
